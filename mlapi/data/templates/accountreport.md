Hi!   
The image(s) in your post appear to contain a common scam. This usually takes the form of your account being reported, with you needing to contact some user claiming to be support to reverse or appeal. This is a scam.

These scams use very similar wording when targeting both Discord and Steam accounts, so I can find it difficult to accurately identify which particular scam you are facing. As such, please refer to the appropriate section:

## Reported your Discord account

Discord will always contact you through email or a [designated SYSTEM direct message channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360036118732-Discord-System-Messages) (which you cannot reply to). They will not ask you to contact a user to handle official support appeals or reports. 

## Reported your Steam account

See [Steam Support :: Scam FAQ](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B)

If this message is being relayed to you by a friend or other contact, then their account has likely been compromised and the hackers are trying to hack your account through them. If you have an alternate means of contacting the actual person, do so and meanwhile block the account and [report it to Discord](https://dis.gd/howtoreport).
