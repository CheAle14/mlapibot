Hi!  
I am responding because I have detected a timestamp showing 1970 or 1969.  
This time correlates to the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), which is the first second of January 1st 1970, with your local timezone then applied on top of it.   
In some situations, the time may say 2015 or 2014, which correlates with [Discord's own epoch](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes-snowflake-id-format-structure-left-to-right).

In many cases, this incorrect timestamp (or glitched message, etc) can be fixed by restarting or reloading your client.
