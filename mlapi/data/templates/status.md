Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain a common joke message placed in the user's custom status or about me. Those words are set by the user, not Discord, and are not any official notice of any kind. Alternatively, if this image is sent by someone else claiming it is showing up on your account whilst not being visible to you, that means they have edited the image (e.g. through PhotoShop or Inspect Element).
