Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain a DM scam. DM scams like these usually come from compromised user or bot accounts.   

This scam in particular appears to be using the official QR code login system meant to speed up logging in on desktop by using your mobile app to authorize a login by scanning a QR code shown. In this instance, a fake "verification" system is used, which actually shows a login QR code instead. Only after you explicitly authorize the login after scanning the code, ignoring the warning from Discord not to do it, is your account compromised. Joining the server itself, or simply scanning the QR code alone, will not cause your account to be compromised.

You should then [follow these steps](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115004307527--Windows-Corrupt-Installation) to fully uninstall Discord, run a complete anti-virus scan, and then re-install Discord. If your account is compromised again when logging in afterwards, you may need to factory reset your computer.

- ... scanned a QR code in-app and then authorized the login: You should change your password.
- ... did something else: You should change your password.
