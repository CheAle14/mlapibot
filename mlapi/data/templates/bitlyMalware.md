Hi!  
If your post is concerning you receiving or sending a message similar to:

> Hi bro, i made a game, please rate it :) [bit.ly link] Password 1234

**Do not open the link**  
The person sending you this message has likely had their account compromised by malware, and that malware has sent you a message trying to compromise your account too.  

If you opened the link, you should change your password to be safe.  
If you downloaded or ran any files from the link, you should run a full anti-virus scan and change your Discord password and any other passwords you think may now be compromised.  

If your account is the one that sent the above message, then your account was compromised: scan for malware and change passwords. You should also message the people your account sent the link to and tell them it was malware.
