Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain a common DM scam

When looking at a possible scam from a bot account, always consider if they:

- Are new, unfamiliar, unverified or contacting you unprompted
- Are not from Discord: not through email from them, or from a [System-tagged account](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036118732)
- Have poor grammar, spelling or misuse punctuation or capitalisation
- Offer things that are 'too good to be true'

- - -

To get rid of this bot, you can:

- Block it
- [Report it to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety)

If these types of bots are repeatedly sending you messages, you can:

- Use Mutual Servers to determine the server(s) they share with you, and disable Direct Messages from server members for those servers.
- If you cannot find any common servers, you can disable DMs from all servers under your User Settings
