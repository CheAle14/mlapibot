Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain a common DM scam. DM scams like these usually come from compromised user accounts, or bot accounts.

When looking at a possible scam from either a bot account or user account, always consider if they:

- Are new, unfamiliar, unverified (in the case of bot accounts) or contacting you unprompted
- Are not from Discord: not through email from them, or from a [System-tagged account](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360036118732)
- Have poor grammar, spelling or misuse punctuation or capitalisation
- Offer things that are 'too good to be true'

Official Discord gifts use the `discord.gift` domain, and will generate a special embed, [shown in this image](https://imgur.com/Xsy1zdE). These gifts can be claimed in-app, by pressing the Accept button, so you should not trust any gift links which cannot be claimed them through that button.

To get rid of this bot, you can:

- Block it
- [Report it to Discord](https://dis.gd/howtoreport)

If these types of bots are repeatedly sending you messages, you can:

- Use Mutual Servers to determine the server(s) they share with you, and disable Direct Messages from server members for those servers.
- If you cannot find any common servers, you can disable DMs from all servers under your User Settings
