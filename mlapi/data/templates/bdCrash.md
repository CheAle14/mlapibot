Hi!  
I am responding because your post title and/or description indicate your Discord is crashing.  
If this is happening when you:

- Paste something into the text area
- Attempt to use an emoji
- Attempt to create a new line through Shift-Enter
- Attempt to type enough words/letters that it would go to a new line
- Generally, any other thing in connection with the text input area

then this could be because of ToS-breaking client modifications that you have installed, or once installed and did not properly uninstall.

A potential fix for these issues would be to:

1. Uninstall Discord properly via the Apps & features option in start menu.
2. Remove the `%appdata%/discord` folder
3. Remove the `%localappdata%/discord` folder
4. Re-install Discord
