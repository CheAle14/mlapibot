Hi!   
The image(s) in your post appear to contain a common scam. This usually takes the form of your account being reported, with you needing to contact some user claiming to be support or a Discord employee to reverse or appeal. This is a scam. Discord will always contact you through email or a designated SYSTEM direct message channel (which you cannot reply to). 

If this message is being relayed to you by a friend or other contact, then their account has likely been compromised and the hackers are trying to hack your account through them. If you have an alternate means of contacting the actual person, do so and meanwhile block the account.
