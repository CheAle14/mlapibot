I am responding because you could be asking how to appeal a ban for a Discord server.

As Discord does not have any official appeal system, how (or if) you can appeal a server ban will vary from server to server - some, for example, may have a form to submit, a website to visit, [etc](https://discord.com/moderation/360060483733-204:-Ban-Appeals).  
In general, you could try contacting a moderator or other staff member from the server to ask about your ban. If you no longer share a server, you will need their username to send them a friend request.

If you don't know their username, you could ask a friend to join and tell you it.  
If no staff members are accepting friend requests, and the server otherwise doesn't have a way for you to appeal the ban, then unfortunately there is nothing you can do.
