Hi!  
Your post appears to contain a link to a malicious website

**Do not open the link**  
The person sending you this message has likely had their account compromised and has sent you a message trying to compromise your account too.  

If you downloaded, or ran, any files from the link you should run a full anti-virus scan and change your Discord password and any other passwords you think may now be compromised.    
If you logged in or scanned a QR code from the website, change your Discord password immediately.
If you *just* opened the link, your account is *likely* safe, but can change your password to be safe.  

If your account is the one that sent the above message, then your account was compromised: scan for malware and change passwords. You should also message the people your account sent the link to and tell them it was malware.
