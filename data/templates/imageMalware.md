The image(s) you've submitted appear to show a [chain letter-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_letter) message, relating to a supposed scam through a loading image.

This particular message appears to be false. There doesn't appear to be any kind of vulnerability involved. It instead works by users opening the website, and being tricked into entering their login details as it _looks like_ the official login page. This is called phishing, and is common - always be cautious of which websites you are visiting and logging in to.
