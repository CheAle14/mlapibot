I am responding because your post title and/or description indicate(s) your Discord is crashing.

Performing a clean re-install as below may fix these issues:

1. Uninstall Discord properly via the Apps & features option in start menu.
2. Remove the `%appdata%/discord` folder
3. Remove the `%localappdata%/discord` folder
4. Re-install Discord

If the issue still persists, you can [search this subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/discordapp/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to see if anyone is experiencing similar issues, or wait for someone else to respond, or [reach out to Discord support](https://dis.gd/support)
