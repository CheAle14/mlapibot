Hi!  
You might be posting about age restricted servers on iOS.  
To view age restricted servers on iOS you will need to enable [the relevant toggle](https://imgur.com/5LW5TWc) on desktop or using desktop mode on your phone's browser.  
Note that you will be unable to *join* age-restricted servers and will be completely unable to join or view servers *specifically focused on explicit pornographic content* even with that toggle enabled.
