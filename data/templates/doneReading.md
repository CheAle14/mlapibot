The image(s) you've provided appear to show the "Done reading?" channel notice.   
This shows when the server has not given you permission to speak in that channel, to point you towards other channels that you can speak in.

Depending on the server, you may be able to get access to the channel (e.g. by agreeing to the rules, or assigning a role, etc), but in
other cases the channel is meant to be read-only (e.g. the rules channel). If in doubt, you can ask the server's moderators/admins.
