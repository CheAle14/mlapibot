The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain someone asking you to test a game or other program.  
You should exercise caution, as the game or program may actually be malware. This may even be the case if the user is someone you trust because _they_ could have been hacked first, and the hackers responsible may be using their account to try and compromise their friends (you).

If you have not yet ran the program:

1. If the user is a stranger, you should avoid running any programs from them and should likely block them.
2. If the user is someone you would otherwise trust, try to verify that you are actually speaking with that person, such as by contacting them outside of Discord to confirm or asking them a question which only they know (and which cannot be answered by looking through your previous messages).

If you have ran the program, then assuming it was malware:

1. You should run a full malware scan.
2. You should change all of your passwords to any accounts that you have used / logged in on that device.
3. If the user is someone you know, you should try to contact them and any mutual friends to let them know the account has been compromised, as the account has likely sent the same message to other users.
