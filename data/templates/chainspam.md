Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to show a [chain letter-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_letter) message.

These messages are almost always false, and almost always spam.  
They serve no purpose other than spreading from server to server spamming people.  
Furthermore, if any users are mentioned in the message, they are more than likely completely innocent people who may now be subject to harassment.
