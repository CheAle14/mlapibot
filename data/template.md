When looking at a possible scam from a bot account, always consider if they:

- Are new, unfamiliar or are not verified
- Are not from Discord: not through email from them, or from a [System-tagged account](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036118732)
- Have poor grammar, spelling or misuse punctuation or capitalisation
- Offer things that are 'too good to be true'
